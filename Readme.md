The Data Structures application shows examples of stacks vs. queues and arrays vs. dictionaries at work.

Stacks vs. Queues

Although they are similar in efficiency, they have unique uses due to the LIFO nature of stacks and the FIFO nature of queues.
Stacks are represented by a stack of clean dishes, while queues are represented by a line of dishes going through an industrial dishwasher

Arrays vs. Dictionaries

Arrays are used over dictionaries because of their performance, but when searching for a specific value, dictionaries are far more efficient
This is demonstrated in the Roster class.
